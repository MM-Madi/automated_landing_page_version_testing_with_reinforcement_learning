# Web Optimization with Reinforcement Learning Multi-Armed Bandits : A Demo for Automating Landing Page Experiments (Version Testing)

This repository showcases a multi-armed bandit RL agent for automating landing-page version testing. A simple demo illustrates how the agent learns through exploration and exploitation to favor higher-converting variants, serving as an intuitive, practical introduction to RL concepts applied to real-world A/B testing scenarios.
